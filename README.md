# odin-recipes
Repository Project for The Odin Project assignment.
This is the first assignment from "The Odin Project", to practice the basics of HTML. 
Once completed I should be able to create a quite basic website using HTML only, using link and images references.

The credits for the images used into this project doesn't belongs to me, but respectively to 
Lasagna: AllRecipes Magazine;
Carbonara: LaCucinaItaliana;
Pizza: TastingTable.
