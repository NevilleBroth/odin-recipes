    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There may be no more beloved Italian dish than carbonara: hot pasta tossed with a creamy sauce of raw beaten eggs, 
        accentuated with crisp bits of guanciale, and finished with a shower of grated aged Pecorino Romano cheese plus freshly 
        ground black pepper. While it is also made with fettuccine, linguine, or bucatini, spaghetti remains the canonical carbonara 
        pasta shape, and the classic recipe contains no butter, cream, or garlic.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package spaghetti;</li>
        <li>5 ounces guanciale (cured pork cheek), cut into small cubes;</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks;</li>
        <li>1 large egg;</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Pecorino-Romano cheese, plus more to serve;</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook pasta 
            uncovered, string occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Reserve a little pasta water, then drain;</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium heat; add guanciale, cook and stir until crisp, 5 to 10 minutes;</li>
        <li>Whisk egg yolks and whole egg together in a bowl; whisk in ¾ cup Pecorino-Romano cheese, salt, and pepper until combined;</li>
        <li>Stir in guanciale. Add spaghetti; toss until evenly coated. Season to taste with extra cheese, salt and pepper; serve.</li>
    </ol>
